# epic-milestone-poc
This repo contains one file, `app.js`, which contains functions necesssary to add milestones to Collab Cycle issue tickets where the milestone corresponds to the corresponding Collab Cycle Request ticket.

The code in `app.js` works but is not meant to be run until we get the go ahead to add milestones.
